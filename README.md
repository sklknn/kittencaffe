I dunno what to do in readme for a project such as this.

## YAY HYPE YUPPIE

Project file structure:
	- art : all things i sucsessfully stoled, in hope i added credits to all of it
	- character : dialogic addon character files/and or ingame npc's/player scene
	- interactions : yoinked from interactible items tutorial. works well, so 
	- items : items
	- levels : game scenes
	- sounds : sfx and music
	- timelines : dialogic timelines for dialogs or so
